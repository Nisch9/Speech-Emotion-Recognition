# 🎙️ Speech-Based Emotion Recognition Using Deep Learning

## 🧠 Summary

Human emotions play a crucial role in communication, and recognizing emotions from speech can significantly improve human-computer interactions. This project aims to develop a deep learning model that analyzes voice patterns and classifies emotions. The goal is to enhance applications in healthcare, virtual assistants, and customer service by making AI more emotionally intelligent.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop a deep learning model for classifying emotions from speech.
- Use advanced speech processing techniques to extract meaningful features.
- Improve the accuracy of emotion recognition using state-of-the-art models.
- Compare different deep learning models to determine the best-performing approach.

## ⚙️ Methodology

### 📁 Dataset
We will use publicly available emotional speech datasets:

- **RAVDESS** – Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song  
- **CREMA-D** – Crowd-Sourced Emotional Multimodal Actors Dataset  
- **IEMOCAP** – Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture Database  
- **TESS** – Toronto Emotional Speech Set

### 🎵 Feature Extraction

We will extract speech features using:

- **MFCCs** (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)
- **Spectrograms**
- **Pitch Analysis**

### 🧠 Model Selection

- Train **CNNs** for spectrogram-based emotion classification.
- Use **LSTMs/RNNs** to model sequential speech data.
- Experiment with **transformer-based models** such as **Wav2Vec** for improved performance.

### 🔧 Implementation Tools

- **Librosa** for audio preprocessing
- **TensorFlow / Keras** or **PyTorch** for deep learning models
- **Data augmentation** techniques to handle noise and improve generalization

## 📊 Evaluation

### ✅ Qualitative Analysis

- Visualize spectrograms to observe patterns across different emotions.

### 📈 Quantitative Analysis

- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score
- Confusion Matrix to analyze misclassifications
- Compare model performance against existing research benchmarks
